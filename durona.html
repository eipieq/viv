                <p>A closed-community luxurious housing marketplace.</p>
                <P>The web is filled with volume players, I thought maybe let’s be a quality player, and create a marketplace where someone looking for luxurious housing can surf without a second thought of verification and accurate presentation, and that in a way gives it the “luxurious housing site” tag like Sotheby’s International Realty but better, so people looking forward to list their house will first consider this for their listing.</p>
                <p>Being a closed-community gives it the exclusivity and ensures that it’s a healthy place for your houses to be listed on.</p>
                <p>As it’s a closed community platform, it’s mostly going to have potential buyers and sellers, which can be great in generating leads and so one can get the price their house deserves than compromising and settling for less, which can be the case while dealing with an agent, as you know, sometimes they have their incentives.</p>
                <p>Here's the pitch deck for better understanding: <a class="cmu-design" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GJaHSzlKuzxQwIVWSEUgFGMFHYy0usbq/view?usp=sharing"><b style="color: #d3b7f8;">the presentation</a>.</p>
                <p>I'm actively looking for people to collab and partner with for this project, lemme know if you're interested.</p>
